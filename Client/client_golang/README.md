This is the microservice client app for sudoku-solving.
The input is hard-coded so if you want to change the input, try changing this code in main.go
`Board := [9][9]int{{input}}`
The input has to be 2-dimentional array with 9x9.
Printing the board is already implemented in the main.go so both your board and solved board will be displayed in the terminal.
